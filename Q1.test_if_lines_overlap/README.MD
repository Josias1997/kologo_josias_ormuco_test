Question A 

Goal : write a program that accepts two lines (x1,x2) and (x3,x4) on the x-axis and returns whether they overlap. 
As an example, (1,5) and (2,6) overlaps but not (1,5) and (6,8).

Functionnalities: Checks if the given lines overlap.
- Input format must be of this type (x1,x2) otherwise an error is returned
- Checks also if x2 is not less than x1 otherwise an error is returned
- The function also considers negative numbers
